Description: A set of scripts to control installed system facilities
 The scripts included in this package provide a common interface to
 control system facilities provided by a number of other packages.
 This is intended for use primarily by packages which are providing
 a facility that can potentially be dangerous to system security,
 to let you enable, disable, or configure the facility independently
 from package installation.
